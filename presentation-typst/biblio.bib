		Nowadays, modern service compositions are increasingly adopted in critical scenarios where advanced Quality of Services (QoS) such as low latency, security, and privacy are fundamental. The landing platforms for the deployment of such compositions are progressively becoming capable to offer capabil-ities that support such advanced QoS requests (e.g., low latency via 5G network slice) spanning the Edge-Cloud Continuum. Actual deployment solutions focus mainly on resource allocation (i.e., CPU, memory, and storage), falling short of addressing advanced QoS and unleashing the true potential of the Edge-Cloud Continuum. In this paper, we present an automatic QoS-aware deployment solution for composed services in the Edge-Cloud Continuum. It compares QoS requests on the service composition with the capabilities of a given continuum in order to find, generate and execute suitable deployment recipes. Our preliminary experimental evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of our solution in a
		realistic scenario.

		Modern (industrial) domains are based on large digital ecosystems where huge amounts of data and information need to be collected, shared, and analyzed by multiple actors working within and across organizational boundaries. This data-driven ecosystem poses strong requirements on data management and data analysis, as well as on data protection and system trustworthiness. However, although Big Data has reached its functional maturity and represents a key enabler for enterprises to compete in the global market, the assurance and trustworthiness of Big Data computations (e.g., security, privacy) are still in their infancy. While functionally appealing, Big Data does not provide a transparent environment with clear non-functional properties, impairing the users' ability to evaluate its behavior and clashing with modern data-privacy regulations. In this paper, we present a novel assurance process for Big Data, which evaluates the Big Data pipelines, and the Big Data ecosystem underneath,
		to provide a comprehensive measure of their trustworthiness. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first attempt to address the general problem of Big Data trustworthiness in an holistic way. We experimentally evaluate our solution in a real Big Data Analytics-as-a-Service environment, first presenting a detailed walkthrough evaluation, and then showing its feasibility and negligible performance overhead (i.e., approx 1 min).

		Nowadays there is an increasing trend in the volume and velocity of data, typically consumed by data-intensive AI/ML-based services, requiring a larger diffusion of more effective Edge computing approaches. In addition, we are experiencing an increment of critical applications using an increasing volume of sensitive data and requiring advanced security and privacy protections. 5G Edge technology can foster a more diffused Edge computing adoption but several challenges in terms of interoperability. Handling data-intensive pipelines on the 5Genabled Edge continuum, considering specific QoS requirements including security and privacy, is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose an initial solution for deploying a data-intensive pipeline in a 5G-enabled Edge continuum satisfying specific QoS requirements. Our approach is based on a QoS-aware meta orchestration modeling of a given pipeline and an orchestration builder generating deployable Edge-specific orchestrations. In this
		paper, we also present an initial walkthrough scenario in the context of a wet lab analysis pipeline to be deployed on the 5G-enabled Edge continuum.

		Information-Centric Networking is an emerging alternative to host-centric networking designed for large-scale content distribution and stricter privacy requirements. Recent research on Information-Centric Networking focused on the protection of the network from attacks targeting the content delivery protocols, while assuming genuine content can always be retrieved from trustworthy nodes. In this paper, we depart from the assumption of the trustworthiness of network nodes and propose a novel certification methodology for informationcentric networks that supports continuous security verification of non-functional properties. Our methodology provides a complete and detailed view of the network security status, increasing the trustworthiness of the network and its services. The proposed approach builds on an enhanced certification model capturing the evolution of the system over time. It also defines certification services that fully integrate with existing networks to collect evidence
		on the target of certification and carry out the certification process. It finally proposes two certification processes, centralized and decentralized, balancing the impact on the network and the system performance. Efficiency, performance, and soundness of our approach are experimentally evaluated in a simulated Named Data Networking (NDN) network targeting property availability.

		The increasing necessity of efficient and effective agriculture has pushed towards the development of computer aided techniques, where on-field measurements are used to take objective decisions to optimize the production, giving birth to data-driven agronomy. With the diffusion of 5G-based IoT devices it becomes possible to deploy a variety of sensors in large amounts, enabling continuous collection of monitoring data. Agronomists necessitate the adoption of Big Data techniques and technologies to handle such large amount of data. These solutions provide powerful tools to analyze and model the complexity of the field, i.e. applying statistics and Machine Learning based methods to the product processes. In this paper, we propose a Big Data infrastructure that integrates with 5G-enabled sensors, providing scalable data ingestion, pipelining and information querying capabilities. We also show a practical scenario where our infrastructure has been implemented and report preliminary
		results on its performance.

		Content-centric networking is emerging as a credible alternative to host-centric networking, especially in scenarios of large-scale content distribution and where privacy requirements are crucial. Recently, research on content-centric networking has focused on security aspects and proposed solutions aimed to protect the network from attacks targeting the content delivery protocols. Content-centric networks are based on the strong assumption of being able to access genuine content from genuine nodes, which is however unrealistic and could open the door to disruptive attacks. Network node misbehavior, either due to poisoning attacks or malfunctioning, can act as a persistent threat that goes unnoticed and causes dangerous consequences. In this paper, we propose a novel certification methodology for content-centric networks that improves transparency and increases trustworthiness of the network and its nodes. The proposed approach builds on behavioral analysis and implements a
		continuous certification process that collects evidence from the network nodes and verifies their non-functional properties using a rule-based inference model. Utility, performance, and soundness of our approach have been experimentally evaluated on a simulated Named Data Networking (NDN) network targeting properties availability, integrity, and non-repudiation.
