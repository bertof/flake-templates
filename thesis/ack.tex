\chapter{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors and mentors, Prof.\ Marco Anisetti and Prof.\ Claudio Ardagna, for their valuable advice, support, and guidance during my PhD studies. Their experience and knowledge have inspired me and helped me grow both as a researcher and as an individual.
I also extend my thanks to Dr.\ Samira Maghool, Prof.\ Paolo Ceravolo, Prof.\ Valerio Bellandi, and Prof.\ Ernesto Damiani for their support in my research.
I would like to thank Dr.\ Massimo Valla, Dr.\ Massimo Banzi and Christina Fra' for their supervision and welcoming collaboration on the more technical aspects of this work.
A special thank also goes to my colleagues and friends in the Sesar Lab, Annalisa Barsotti, Dr.\ Samira Maghool, Antongiacomo Polimeno, Dr.\ Gabriel Marques Tavares, Jonatan Maggesi, Nicola Bena, Rafael Seidi Oyamada, and Ruslan Bondaruc. Their support and the many laughs we shared made my study and life in Milan a wonderful experience.
