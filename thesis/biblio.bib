		Modern (industrial) domains are based on large digital ecosystems where huge amounts of data and information need to be collected, shared, and analyzed by multiple actors working within and across organizational boundaries. This data-driven ecosystem poses strong requirements on data management and data analysis, as well as on data protection and system trustworthiness. However, although Big Data has reached its functional maturity and represents a key enabler for enterprises to compete in the global market, the assurance and trustworthiness of Big Data computations (e.g., security, privacy) are still in their infancy. While functionally appealing, Big Data does not provide a transparent environment with clear non-functional properties, impairing the users' ability to evaluate its behavior and clashing with modern data-privacy regulations. In this paper, we present a novel assurance process for Big Data, which evaluates the Big Data pipelines, and the Big Data ecosystem underneath,
		to provide a comprehensive measure of their trustworthiness. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first attempt to address the general problem of Big Data trustworthiness in an holistic way. We experimentally evaluate our solution in a real Big Data Analytics-as-a-Service environment, first presenting a detailed walkthrough evaluation, and then showing its feasibility and negligible performance overhead (i.e., approx 1 min).

		Nowadays, modern service compositions are increasingly adopted in critical scenarios where advanced Quality of Services (QoS) such as low latency, security, and privacy are fundamental. The landing platforms for the deployment of such compositions are progressively becoming capable to offer capabilities that support such advanced QoS requests (e.g., low latency via 5G network slice) spanning the Edge-Cloud Continuum. Actual deployment solutions focus mainly on resource allocation (i.e., CPU, memory, and storage), falling short of addressing advanced QoS and unleashing the true potential of the Edge-Cloud Continuum. In this paper, we present an automatic QoS-aware deployment solution for composed services in the Edge-Cloud Continuum. It compares QoS requests on the service composition with the capabilities of a given continuum in order to find, generate and execute suitable deployment recipes. Our preliminary experimental evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of our solution in a
		realistic scenario.

However, due to virtualization and softwareization and other technical characteristics, NFV faces more serious security threats compared to traditional networks. This paper focuses on analyzing the NFV security threats under the new technology and summarizes them according to the causes of security threats.

		Information-Centric Networking is an emerging alternative to host-centric networking designed for large-scale content distribution and stricter privacy requirements. Recent research on Information-Centric Networking focused on the protection of the network from attacks targeting the content delivery protocols, while assuming genuine content can always be retrieved from trustworthy nodes. In this paper, we depart from the assumption of the trustworthiness of network nodes and propose a novel certification methodology for informationcentric networks that supports continuous security verification of non-functional properties. Our methodology provides a complete and detailed view of the network security status, increasing the trustworthiness of the network and its services. The proposed approach builds on an enhanced certification model capturing the evolution of the system over time. It also defines certification services that fully integrate with existing networks to collect evidence
		on the target of certification and carry out the certification process. It finally proposes two certification processes, centralized and decentralized, balancing the impact on the network and the system performance. Efficiency, performance, and soundness of our approach are experimentally evaluated in a simulated Named Data Networking (NDN) network targeting property availability.

		Nowadays there is an increasing trend in the volume and velocity of data, typically consumed by data-intensive AI/ML-based services, requiring a larger diffusion of more effective Edge computing approaches. In addition, we are experiencing an increment of critical applications using an increasing volume of sensitive data and requiring advanced security and privacy protections. 5G Edge technology can foster a more diffused Edge computing adoption but several challenges in terms of interoperability. Handling data-intensive pipelines on the 5Genabled Edge continuum, considering specific QoS requirements including security and privacy, is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose an initial solution for deploying a data-intensive pipeline in a 5G-enabled Edge continuum satisfying specific QoS requirements. Our approach is based on a QoS-aware meta orchestration modeling of a given pipeline and an orchestration builder generating deployable Edge-specific orchestrations. In this
		paper, we also present an initial walkthrough scenario in the context of a wet lab analysis pipeline to be deployed on the 5G-enabled Edge continuum.

		The increasing necessity of efficient and effective agriculture has pushed towards the development of computer aided techniques, where on-field measurements are used to take objective decisions to optimize the production, giving birth to data-driven agronomy. With the diffusion of 5G-based IoT devices it becomes possible to deploy a variety of sensors in large amounts, enabling continuous collection of monitoring data. Agronomists necessitate the adoption of Big Data techniques and technologies to handle such large amount of data. These solutions provide powerful tools to analyze and model the complexity of the field, i.e. applying statistics and Machine Learning based methods to the product processes. In this paper, we propose a Big Data infrastructure that integrates with 5G-enabled sensors, providing scalable data ingestion, pipelining and information querying capabilities. We also show a practical scenario where our infrastructure has been implemented and report preliminary
		results on its performance.

		Scalable data processing platforms built on cloud computing becomes increasingly attractive as infrastructure for supporting big data applications. But privacy concerns are one of the major obstacles to making use of public cloud platforms. Multidimensional anonymisation, a global-recoding generalisation scheme for privacy-preserving data publishing, has been a recent focus due to its capability of balancing data obfuscation and usability. Existing multidimensional anonymisation methods suffer from scalability problems when handling big data due to the impractical serial I/O cost. Given the recursive feature of multidimensional anonymisation, parallelisation is an ideal solution to scalability issues. However, it is still a challenge to use existing distributed and parallel paradigms directly for recursive computation. In this paper, we propose a scalable approach for big data multidimensional anonymisation based on MapReduce, a state-of-the-art data processing paradigm. Our basic
		idea is to partition a data set recursively into smaller partitions using MapReduce until all partitions can fit in the memory of a computing node. A tree indexing structure is proposed to achieve recursive computation. Moreover, we show the applicability of our approach to differential privacy. Experimental results on real-life data demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the scalability of multidimensional anonymisation over existing methods.

		Since its release in 2014, Kubernetes has become a popular choice for orchestrating containerized workloads at scale. To determine the most appropriate node to host a given workload, Kubernetes makes use of a scheduler that takes into account a set of hard and soft constraints defined by workload owners and cluster administrators. Despite being highly configurable, the default Kubernetes scheduler cannot fully meet the requirements of emerging applications, such as machine/deep learning workloads and edge computing applications. This has led to different proposals of custom Kubernetes schedulers that focus on addressing the requirements of the aforementioned applications. Since the related literature is growing in this area, we aimed, in this survey, to provide a classification of the related literature based on multiple criteria, including scheduling objectives as well as the types of considered workloads and environments. Additionally, we provide an overview of the main approaches
		that have been adopted to achieve each objective. Finally, we highlight a set of gaps that could be leveraged by academia or the industry to drive further research and development activities in the area of custom scheduling in Kubernetes.

		Continuous integration enables the development of microservices-based applications using container virtualization technology. Container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, which has become the de facto standard, simplify the deployment of container-based applications. However, developing efficient and well-defined orchestration systems is a challenge. This article focuses specifically on the scheduler, a key orchestrator task that assigns physical resources to containers. Scheduling approaches are designed based on different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to provide limited response time, efficient energy consumption, better resource utilization, and other things. This article aims to establish insight knowledge into Kubernetes scheduling, find the main gaps, and thus guide future research in the area. Therefore, we conduct a study of empirical research on Kubernetes scheduling techniques and present a new taxonomy for Kubernetes scheduling. The challenges, future
		direction, and research opportunities are also discussed.

		With the development of various vertical industry services such as autonomous driving, energy Internet, and smart cities, mobile communication networks need to provide users with ubiquitous high-speed access while using limited network resources to provide differentiated and customized services, the 5G network satisfies the requirement of the future. However, for the access network, there are many types services accessing the network. In order to provide users with diverse personalized services, network slicing scheme is introduced into 5G network. Network slicing is based on the technology of network function virtualization, which can establish multiple virtual private networks in the device according to the needs of users. Each slice is a private network, and different virtual networks are kept isolated from each other. This article studies the access network of the 5G network, in order to ensure the quality of user access, we study the mapping scheme of network slices and NFV to
		ensure the communication quality of access networks of different user types. Finally, we perform some simulations to verify the proposed method, and the result shows that our proposed can ensure the communication quality for the users which connect into the 5G network.

		Content-centric networking is emerging as a credible alternative to host-centric networking, especially in scenarios of large-scale content distribution and where privacy requirements are crucial. Recently, research on content-centric networking has focused on security aspects and proposed solutions aimed to protect the network from attacks targeting the content delivery protocols. Content-centric networks are based on the strong assumption of being able to access genuine content from genuine nodes, which is however unrealistic and could open the door to disruptive attacks. Network node misbehavior, either due to poisoning attacks or malfunctioning, can act as a persistent threat that goes unnoticed and causes dangerous consequences. In this paper, we propose a novel certification methodology for content-centric networks that improves transparency and increases trustworthiness of the network and its nodes. The proposed approach builds on behavioral analysis and implements a
		continuous certification process that collects evidence from the network nodes and verifies their non-functional properties using a rule-based inference model. Utility, performance, and soundness of our approach have been experimentally evaluated on a simulated Named Data Networking (NDN) network targeting properties availability, integrity, and non-repudiation.

		``Knowledge is power'' is an old adage that has been found to be true in today's information age. Knowledge is derived from having access to information. The ability to gather information from large volumes of data has become an issue of relative importance. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is the term coined by researchers to describe the art of processing, storing and gathering large amounts of data for future examination. Data is being produced at an alarming rate. The rapid growth of the Internet, Internet of Things (IoT) and other technological advances are the main culprits behind this sustained growth. The data generated is a reflection of the environment it is produced out of, thus we can use the data we get out of systems to figure out the inner workings of that system. This has become an important feature in cybersecurity where the goal is to protect assets. Furthermore, the growing value of data has made big data a high value target. In this paper, we explore recent research
		works in cybersecurity in relation to big data. We highlight how big data is protected and how big data can also be used as a tool for cybersecurity. We summarize recent works in the form of tables and have presented trends, open research challenges and problems. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of cybersecurity in the big data era, as well as research trends and open challenges in this active research area.

		The Big Data revolution promises to build a data-driven ecosystem where better decisions are supported by enhanced analytics and data management. However, major hurdles still need to be overcome on the road that leads to commoditization and wide adoption of Big Data Analytics (BDA). Big Data complexity is the first factor hampering the full potential of BDA. The opacity and variety of Big Data technologies and computations, in fact, make BDA a failure prone and resource-intensive process, which requires a trial-and-error approach. This problem is even exacerbated by the fact that current solutions to Big Data application development take a bottom-up approach, where the last technology release drives application development. Selection of the best Big Data platform, as well as of the best pipeline to execute analytics, represents then a deal breaker. In this paper, we propose a return to roots by defining a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) methodology that supports automation of BDA
		based on model specification. Our approach lets customers declare requirements to be achieved by an abstract Big Data platform and smart engines deploy the Big Data pipeline carrying out the analytics on a specific instance of such platform. Driven by customers' requirements, our methodology is based on an OWL-S ontology of Big Data services and on a compiler transforming OWL-S service compositions in workflows that can be directly executed on the selected platform. The proposal is experimentally evaluated in a real-world scenario focusing on the threat detection system of SAP.

		Cloud computing dominates all kinds of computing in the network due to the service-oriented and on-demand nature of the model. The customer uses a cloud model for fulfilling the resource needs with minimum cost. Cloud security plays a vital role as it is securing the customer data in a more reliable manner. Various levels of security issues imposed by the cloud provider are still considered to be a problem in the resource level. Virtualization security technique is used to prevent the Virtual Machine (VM) and related information like data, state and shared resources. VM side channel attack leads to severe issues in the cloud because the attacker is performing access of the resources that causes the reliability problem. The main objective of this analysis isto explore various kinds of attacks and its solution model of the cloud. Side channel attacks are detected by using various techniques such as RSA and AES. Infrastructure level attacks are analyzed with various attack levels and
		rates. Hypervisor level protection is assessed by using the different classes with accurate parameters. The overall analysis provides the complete information about cloud resource level security and its solution.

		Transient execution attacks, also known as speculative execution attacks, have drawn much interest in the last few years as they can cause critical data leakage. Since the first disclosure of Spectre and Meltdown attacks in January 2018, a number of new transient execution attack types have been demonstrated targeting different processors. A transient execution attack consists of two main components: transient execution itself and a covert channel that is used to actually exfiltrate the information.Transient execution is a result of the fundamental features of modern processors that are designed to boost performance and efficiency, while covert channels are unintended information leakage channels that result from temporal and spatial sharing of the micro-architectural components. Given the severity of the transient execution attacks, they have motivated computer architects in both industry and academia to rethink the design of the processors and to propose hardware defenses. To help
		understand the transient execution attacks, this survey summarizes the phases of the attacks and the security boundaries across which the information is leaked in different attacks.This survey further analyzes the causes of transient execution as well as the different types of covert channels and presents a taxonomy of the attacks based on the causes and types. This survey in addition presents metrics for comparing different aspects of the transient execution attacks and uses them to evaluate the feasibility of the different attacks. This survey especially considers both existing attacks and potential new attacks suggested by our analysis. This survey finishes by discussing different mitigations that have so far been proposed at the micro-architecture level and discusses their benefits and limitations.

		Among the possible future Internet architectures, Information Centric Networking (ICN) is the most promising one and researchers working on the Named Data Networking (NDN) project are putting efforts towards its deployment in a real scenario. To properly handle content names, the different components of an NDN network need efficient and scalable data structures. In this paper, we propose a new data structure to support the NDN forwarding procedure by replacing the current Forwarding Information Base (FIB): the Spatial Bloom Filter (SBF), a probabilistic data structure that guarantees fast lookup and efficient memory consumption. Through a set of simulations run to compare the performance of FIB and SBF, we found that the latter uses less than 5 KB of data to handle 106 queried interests, with a (negligible) probability 10-4 of false positive events. Conversely, the FIB requires up to 2.5 GB of data in disadvantageous cases, e.g. when interests are composed of a considerable number
		of components.

		Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been proposed as one of the future Internet architectures. It is poised to address the challenges faced by today's Internet that include, but not limited to, scalability, addressing, security, and privacy. Furthermore, it also aims at meeting the requirements for new emerging Internet applications. To realize ICN, Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the recent implementations of ICN that provides a suitable communication approach due to its clean slate design and simple communication model. There are a plethora of applications realized through ICN in different domains where data is the focal point of communication. One such domain is Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) realized through Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET) where vehicles exchange information and content with each other and with the infrastructure. To date, excellent research results have been yielded in the VANET domain aiming at safe, reliable, and infotainment-rich driving
		experience. However, due to the dynamic topologies, host-centric model, and ephemeral nature of vehicular communication, various challenges are faced by VANET that hinder the realization of successful vehicular networks and adversely affect the data dissemination, content delivery, and user experiences. To fill these gaps, NDN has been extensively used as underlying communication paradigm for VANET.

		Traditional assurance solutions for software-based systems rely on static verification techniques and assume continuous availability of trusted third parties. With the advent of cloud computing, these solutions become ineffective since services/applications are flexible, dynamic, and change at runtime, at high rates. Although several assurance approaches have been defined, cloud requires a step-change moving current assurance techniques to fully embrace the cloud peculiarities. In this paper, we provide a rigorous and adaptive assurance technique based on certification, towards the definition of a transparent and trusted cloud ecosystem. It aims to increase the confidence of cloud customers that every piece of the cloud (from its infrastructure to hosted applications) behaves as expected and according to their requirements. We first present a test-based certification scheme proving non-functional properties of cloud-based services. The scheme is driven by non-functional requirements
		defined by the certification authority and by a model of the service under certification. We then define an automatic approach to verification of consistency between requirements and models, which is at the basis of the chain of trust supported by the certification scheme. We also present a continuous certificate life cycle management process including both certificate issuing and its adaptation to address contextual changes. Finally, we describe our certification framework and an experimental evaluation of its performance, quality, applicability, and practical usability in a real industrial scenario, which considers Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A.

		Driven by the emergence of new compute-intensive applications and the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is foreseen that the emerging 5G network will face an unprecedented increase in traffic volume and computation demands. However, end users mostly have limited storage capacities and finite processing capabilities, thus how to run compute-intensive applications on resource-constrained users has recently become a natural concern. Mobile edge computing (MEC), a key technology in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network, can optimize mobile resources by hosting compute-intensive applications, process large data before sending to the cloud, provide the cloud-computing capabilities within the radio access network (RAN) in close proximity to mobile users, and offer context-aware services with the help of RAN information. Therefore, MEC enables a wide variety of applications, where the real-time response is strictly required, e.g., driverless vehicles, augmented reality,
		robotics, and immerse media. Indeed, the paradigm shift from 4G to 5G could become a reality with the advent of new technological concepts. The successful realization of MEC in the 5G network is still in its infancy and demands for constant efforts from both academic and industry communities. In this survey, we first provide a holistic overview of MEC technology and its potential use cases and applications. Then, we outline up-to-date researches on the integration of MEC with the new technologies that will be deployed in 5G and beyond. We also summarize testbeds and experimental evaluations, and open source activities, for edge computing. We further summarize lessons learned from state-of-the-art research works as well as discuss challenges and potential future directions for MEC research.

		With proliferation of smart devices and wireless applications, the recent few years have witnessed data surge. These massive data needs to be stored, transmitted, and processed in time to exploit their value for decision making. Conventional cloud computing requires transmission of massive amount of data in and out of core network, which can lead to longer service latency and potential traffic congestion. As a new platform, mobile edge computing (MEC) moves computation and storage resources to edge network in proximity to the data source. With MEC, data can be processed locally, and thus mitigate issues of latency and congestion. However, it is very challenging to reap the benefits of MEC everywhere due to geographic constraints, expensive deployment cost, and immoveable base stations. Because of easy deployment and high mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), air-ground integrated mobile edge networks (AGMEN) is proposed, where UAVs are employed to assist the MEC network. Such
		an AGMEN expects to provide MEC services ubiquitously and reliably. In this article, we first introduce the characteristics and components of UAV. Then, we will review the applications, key challenges, and current research technologies of AGMEN, from perspectives of communication, computation, and caching, respectively. Finally, we will discuss some essential research directions for AGMEN.

		The concept of edge caching provision in emerging 5G and beyond mobile networks is a promising method to deal both with the traffic congestion problem in the core network, as well as reducing latency to access popular content. In that respect, end user demand for popular content can be satisfied by proactively caching it at the network edge, i.e., at close proximity to the users. In addition to model-based caching schemes, learning-based edge caching optimizations have recently attracted significant attention, and the aim hereafter is to capture these recent advances for both model-based and data-driven techniques in the area of proactive caching. This paper summarizes the utilization of deep learning for data caching in edge network. We first outline the typical research topics in content caching and formulate a taxonomy based on network hierarchical structure. Then, many key types of deep learning algorithms are presented, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning,
		as well as reinforcement learning. Furthermore, a comparison of state-of-the-art literature is provided from the aspects of caching topics and deep learning methods. Finally, we discuss research challenges and future directions of applying deep learning for caching.

		Millions of sensors continuously produce and transmit data to control real-world infrastructures using complex networks in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, IoT devices are limited in computational power, including storage, processing, and communication resources, to effectively perform compute-intensive tasks locally. Edge computing resolves the resource limitation problems by bringing computation closer to the edge of IoT devices. Providing distributed edge nodes across the network reduces the stress of centralized computation and overcomes latency challenges in the IoT. Therefore, edge computing presents low-cost solutions for compute-intensive tasks. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables effective network management by presenting a global perspective of the network. While SDN was not explicitly developed for IoT challenges, it can, however, provide impetus to solve the complexity issues and help in efficient IoT service orchestration. The current IoT paradigm of massive
		data generation, complex infrastructures, security vulnerabilities, and requirements from the newly developed technologies make IoT realization a challenging issue. In this research, we provide an extensive survey on SDN and the edge computing ecosystem to solve the challenge of complex IoT management. We present the latest research on Software-Defined Internet of Things orchestration using Edge (SDIoT-Edge) and highlight key requirements and standardization efforts in integrating these diverse architectures. An extensive discussion on different case studies using SDIoT-Edge computing is presented to envision the underlying concept. Furthermore, we classify state-of-the-art research in the SDIoT-Edge ecosystem based on multiple performance parameters. We comprehensively present security and privacy vulnerabilities in the SDIoT-Edge computing and provide detailed taxonomies of multiple attack possibilities in this paradigm. We highlight the lessons learned based on our findings at
		the end of each section. Finally, we discuss critical insights toward current research issues, challenges, and further research directions to efficiently provide IoT services in the SDIoT-Edge paradigm.

		The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and their interference with our daily life tasks have led to a large number of IoT devices and enormous sizes of IoT-generated data. The resources of IoT devices are limited; therefore, the processing and storing IoT data in these devices are inefficient. Traditional cloud-computing resources are used to partially handle some of the IoT resource-limitation issues; however, using the resources in cloud centers leads to other issues, such as latency in time-critical IoT applications. Therefore, edge-cloud-computing technology has recently evolved. This technology allows for data processing and storage at the edge of the network. This paper studies, in-depth, edge-computing architectures for IoT (ECAs-IoT), and then classifies them according to different factors such as data placement, orchestration services, security, and big data. Besides, the paper studies each architecture in depth and compares them according to various
		features. Additionally, ECAs-IoT is mapped according to two existing IoT layered models, which helps in identifying the capabilities, features, and gaps of every architecture. Moreover, the paper presents the most important limitations of existing ECAs-IoT and recommends solutions to them. Furthermore, this survey details the IoT applications in the edge-computing domain. Lastly, the paper recommends four different scenarios for using ECAs-IoT by IoT applications.

		STN has been considered a novel network architecture to accommodate a variety of services and applications in future networks. Being a promising paradigm, MEC has been regarded as a key technology-enabler to offer further service innovation and business agility in STN. However, most of the existing research in MEC enabled STN regards a satellite network as a relay network, and the feasibility of tasks processing directly on the satellites is largely ignored. Moreover, the problem of multi-layer edge computing architecture design and heterogeneous edge computing resource co-scheduling, have not been fully considered. Therefore, different from previous works, in this article, we propose a novel architecture named STECN, in which computing resources exist in multi-layer heterogeneous edge computing clusters. The detailed functional components of the proposed STECN are discussed, and we present the promising technical challenges, including meeting QoE requirements, cooperative
		computation offloading, multi-node task scheduling, mobility management and fault/failure recovery. Finally, some potential research issues for future research are highlighted.

		The explosive growth of various services boosts the innovation and development in terrestrial communication systems for the implementation of the next generation mobile communication networks. However, simply utilizing limited resources in terrestrial communication networks is difficult to support the massive quality of service (QoS) aware requirements and it is hard to guarantee seamless coverage in far remote regions. Leveraging the intrinsic merits of high altitude and the ability of multicasting or broadcasting, satellite communication systems provide an opportunity for novel mobile communication networks with its tight interaction and complementary characteristics to traditional terrestrial networks. It is believed that the convergence of satellite and terrestrial networks can solve the problems existing in current mobile communication systems and make a profound effect on global information dissemination. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey on the convergence of
		satellite and terrestrial networks. First, motivations and requirements of satellite-terrestrial network convergence are identified. Then, we summarize related architectures of existing literature, classify the taxonomy of researches on satellite-terrestrial networks, and present the performance evaluation works in different satellite-terrestrial networks. After that, the state-of-the-art of standardization, projects and the key application areas of satellite-terrestrial networks are also reviewed. Finally, we conclude the survey by highlighting the open issues and future directions.

The Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) systems are able to satisfy the requests of anywhere and anytime connections by offering wide-area coverage and ensuring service availability, continuity, and scalability. In this work, we review the 3GPP NTN features and their potential for satisfying the user expectations in 5G \& beyond networks. The state of the art, current 3GPP research activities, and open issues are summarized to highlight the importance of NTN over the wireless communication landscape. Future research directions are also identified to assess the role of NTN in 5G and beyond systems.}

		Recently, Content Delivery Networks (CDN) have become more and more popular. The technology itself is ahead of academic research in this area. Several dimensions of the technology have not been adequately investigated by academia. These dimensions include outline management, security, and standardization. Discovering and highlighting aspects of this technology that may have or have not been covered by academic research is the first step toward helping academia bridge the gap with industry or even go one step further to lead industry in the right direction. This suggests a comprehensive survey on research works in this regard. The literature in this area has already come up with some surveys and taxonomies, but some of them are outdated or do not cover every aspect of CDN while others fail to detect existing trends or to develop a holistic roadmap for research on the technology. Furthermore, none of the existing surveys aim at enlightening the dark aspects of the technology that have
		not been subject to academic research. In this survey, we first extract the lifecycle of a CDN as suggested by the existing research. Then, we investigate previous relevant works on each phase of the lifecycle to clarify where the research is currently located and headed. We show how CDN technology tends to converge with emerging paradigms such as cloud computing, edge computing, and machine learning, which are more mature in terms of academic research. This helps us determine the right direction for further research by revealing the deficiencies in existing works.

		Nowadays, security aspects represent one of the most significant barriers for the adoption of large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. In this sense, being able to certify and communicate the security level of a certain device is crucial for their acceptance. Towards this end, we propose a security certification methodology designed for IoT to empower different stakeholders with the ability to assess security solutions for large-scale IoT deployments in an automated way. It also supports transparency on the IoT security level to the consumers because the methodology provides a label as one of the main results of the certification process. The certification approach represents an instantiation of the Risk-based Security Assessment and Testing methodologies presented by ETSI based on the ISO 31000 and ISO 29119, and it is built on top of different technologies and approaches for security testing and risk assessment adapted to the IoT landscape. As a proof of concept, the
		proposed methodology is applied to one of the scenarios proposed in the scope of the Horizon 2020 ARMOUR project for assessing the fulfillment of several security properties of IoT devices.

		Dramatic changes in the technology landscape marked by increasing scales and pervasiveness of compute and data have resulted in the proliferation of edge applications aimed at effectively processing data in a timely manner. As the levels and fidelity of instrumentation increases and the types and volumes of available data grow, new classes of applications are being explored that seamlessly combine real-time data with complex models and data analytics to monitor and manage systems of interest. However, these applications require a fluid integration of resources at the edge, the core, and along the data path to support dynamic and data-driven application workflows, that is, they need to leverage a computing continuum. In this article, we present our vision for enabling such a computing continuum and specifically focus on enabling edge-to-cloud integration to support data-driven workflows. The research is driven by an online data-driven tsunami warning use case that is supported by the
		deployment of large-scale national environment observation systems. This article presents our overall approach as well as current status and next steps.

		Containers emerged as a lightweight alternative to virtual machines (VMs) that offer better microservice architecture support. The value of the container market is expected to reach 2.7 billion in 2020 as compared to 762 million in 2016. Although they are considered the standardized method for microservices deployment, playing an important role in cloud computing emerging fields such as service meshes, market surveys show that container security is the main concern and adoption barrier for many companies. In this paper, we survey the literature on container security and solutions. We have derived four generalized use cases that should cover security requirements within the host-container threat landscape. The use cases include: (I) protecting a container from applications inside it, (II) inter-container protection, (III) protecting the host from containers, and (IV) protecting containers from a malicious or semi-honest host. We found that the first three use cases utilize a
		software-based solutions that mainly rely on Linux kernel features (e.g., namespaces, CGroups, capabilities, and seccomp) and Linux security modules (e.g., AppArmor). The last use case relies on hardware-based solutions such as trusted platform modules (TPMs) and trusted platform support (e.g., Intel SGX). We hope that our analysis will help researchers understand container security requirements and obtain a clearer picture of possible vulnerabilities and attacks. Finally, we highlight open research problems and future research directions that may spawn further research in this area.

		5G is the next generation cellular network that aspires to achieve substantial improvement on quality of service, such as higher throughput and lower latency. Edge computing is an emerging technology that enables the evolution to 5G by bringing cloud capabilities near to the end users (or user equipment, UEs) in order to overcome the intrinsic problems of the traditional cloud, such as high latency and the lack of security. In this paper, we establish a taxonomy of edge computing in 5G, which gives an overview of existing state-of-the-art solutions of edge computing in 5G on the basis of objectives, computational platforms, attributes, 5G functions, performance measures, and roles. We also present other important aspects, including the key requirements for its successful deployment in 5G and the applications of edge computing in 5G. Then, we explore, highlight, and categorize recent advancements in edge computing for 5G. By doing so, we reveal the salient features of different edge
		computing paradigms for 5G. Finally, open research issues are outlined.

		With the tremendous revival of artificial intelligence, predictive maintenance (PdM) based on data-driven methods has become the most effective solution to address smart manufacturing and industrial big data, especially for performing health perception (e.g., fault diagnosis and remaining life assessment). Moreover, because the existing PdM research is still in primary experimental stage, most works are conducted utilizing several open-datasets, and the combination with specific applications such as rotating machinery is especially rare. Hence, in this paper, we focus on data-driven methods for PdM, present a comprehensive survey on its applications, and attempt to provide graduate students, companies, and institutions with the preliminary understanding of the existing works recently published. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the PdM approach, illustrate our PdM scheme for automatic washing equipment, and demonstrate the challenges encountered when we conduct a PdM
		research. Second, we classify the specific industrial applications based on six algorithms of machine learning and deep learning (DL), and compare five performance metrics for each classification. Furthermore, the accuracy (a metric to evaluate the algorithm performance) of these PdM applications is analyzed in detail. There are some important conclusions: 1) the data used in the summarized literature are mostly from public datasets, such as case western reserve university (CWRU)/intelligent maintenance systems (IMS); and 2) in recent years, researchers seem to focus more on DL algorithms for PdM research. Finally, we summarize the common features regarding our surveyed PdM applications and discuss several potential directions.

		As a concept to enhance and extend cloud-computing capabilities, edge computing aims to provide Internet-based services in the close proximity to users by placing IT infrastructures at the network edge in forms of tiny datacenters. Taking advantage of the close distance to end user and access networks, edge datacenters can provide low-latency and context-aware services and further improve users' quality of experience. As the network edge is a geographically spread concept, the edge datacenters are usually highly distributed so that they can provide nearby storage and processing capabilities to most of the end users. Furthermore, edge datacenters also co-work with centralized cloud datacenters for service orchestration. Such decentralization and collaboration are expected to introduce significant transformations to both infrastructures and applications. To provide an overview of how edge can be integrated with cloud-computing and how edge computing can benefit applications, this
		paper studies the infrastructure and application issues of edge computing and networking in several sub-aspects, including related concepts, infrastructures, resource management and virtualization, performance, and applications.

		Performance and dependability levels of cloud-based computations are difficult to guarantee by-design due to segregation of visibility and control between applications, data owners, and cloud providers. Lack of predictability increases users' uncertainty about the service levels they will actually achieve. Cloud tenants compete for shared resources/services at all layers of the cloud stack, and pose heterogeneous and conflicting non-functional requirements over them. These requirements have implications for platform and infrastructure layers, which have to be configured to satisfy inter-tenants requirements. We argue that adaptation techniques can play a crucial role in providing a reliable cloud, supporting definite behavior of applications and stable quality of service. Existing adaptation techniques however are unsuitable for cloud use, since they mostly focus on single tenancy, performance requirements, and are based on unverifiable evidence, which is collected in an untrusted
		way. In this paper, we propose a multi-tenant, general-purpose adaptation technique for the cloud, based on evidence collected by means of a trustworthy certification process. We depart from traditional heavy and comprehensive certification processes, such as ISO/IEC 27017, and consider a flexible and lightweight certification process for the cloud. It is based on authentic evidence and provides accountable validation on the compliance of a cloud-based system. Our approach adapts the cloud at all layers to maintain stable non-functional properties in certificates over time, by continuously verifying certificate validity. We assess the performance and quality of our adaptation approach in a wide range of settings.

		The diffusion of service-based and cloud-based systems has created a scenario where software is often made available as services, offered as commodities over corporate networks or the global net. This scenario supports the definition of business processes as composite services, which are implemented via either static or runtime composition of offerings provided by different suppliers. Fast and accurate evaluation of services' security properties becomes then a fundamental requirement and is nowadays part of the software development process. In this article, we show how the verification of security properties of composite services can be handled by test-based security certification and built to be effective and efficient in dynamic composition scenarios. Our approach builds on existing security certification schemes for monolithic services and extends them towards service compositions. It virtually certifies composite services, starting from certificates awarded to the component
		services. We describe three heuristic algorithms for generating runtime test-based evidence of the composite service holding the properties. These algorithms are compared with the corresponding exhaustive algorithm to evaluate their quality and performance. We also evaluate the proposed approach in a real-world industrial scenario, which considers ENGpay online payment system of Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. The proposed industrial evaluation presents the utility and generality of the proposed approach by showing how certification results can be used as a basis to establish compliance to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.

In this paper, a novel architecture of 5G via CCN, named as CCN-5G, is proposed. Meanwhile, the performance of CCN-5G are tested in the high-speed mobile environment. The simulation results show that the CCN-5G can achieve excellent performance and satisfy the future requirements of 5G.},

		As the explosive growth of smart devices and the advent of many new applications, traffic volume has been growing exponentially. The traditional centralized network architecture cannot accommodate such user demands due to heavy burden on the backhaul links and long latency. Therefore, new architectures, which bring network functions and contents to the network edge, are proposed, i.e., mobile edge computing and caching. Mobile edge networks provide cloud computing and caching capabilities at the edge of cellular networks. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art research efforts on mobile edge networks. We first give an overview of mobile edge networks, including definition, architecture, and advantages. Next, a comprehensive survey of issues on computing, caching, and communication techniques at the network edge is presented. The applications and use cases of mobile edge networks are discussed. Subsequently, the key enablers of mobile edge networks, such
		as cloud technology, SDN/NFV, and smart devices are discussed. Finally, open research challenges and future directions are presented as well.

The emphasis is put on the problem of security of data being sent, data at rest and data being processed and deleted from the system. Different kind of techniques to assure authenticity and provenance are also presented. The need for third-party trust centers is explained. The necessity for external control as far as international low obedience is justified.},

		Information-centric networking (ICN) is a new communication paradigm that focuses on content retrieval from a network regardless of the storage location or physical representation of this content. In ICN, securing the content itself is much more important than securing the infrastructure or the endpoints. To achieve the security goals in this new paradigm, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of ICN attacks, their classification, and proposed solutions. In this paper, we provide a survey of attacks unique to ICN architectures and other generic attacks that have an impact on ICN. It also provides a taxonomy of these attacks in ICN, which are classified into four main categories, i.e., naming, routing, caching, and other miscellaneous related attacks. Furthermore, this paper shows the relation between ICN attacks and unique ICN attributes, and that between ICN attacks and security requirements, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy. Finally, this
		paper presents the severity levels of ICN attacks and discusses the existing ICN security solutions.

By setting up an application-specific communication channel and controller layer parallel to the application agnostic OpenFlow protocol, we obtain a mechanism to deploy specific optimizations into a network without requiring a full network upgrade or OpenFlow protocol change. Our open-source software implementation consists of both an NDN-specific controller module and an NDN client plug-in. NDNFlow allows OpenFlow networks with NDN capabilities to exploit the benefits of NDN, by enabling the use of intermediate caches, identifying flows of content and eventually performing traffic engineering based on these principles.},

		The cloud computing paradigm has become a mainstream solution for the deployment of business processes and applications. In the public cloud vision, infrastructure, platform, and software services are provisioned to tenants (i.e., customers and service providers) on a pay-as-you-go basis. Cloud tenants can use cloud resources at lower prices, and higher performance and flexibility, than traditional on-premises resources, without having to care about infrastructure management. Still, cloud tenants remain concerned with the cloud's level of service and the nonfunctional properties their applications can count on. In the last few years, the research community has been focusing on the nonfunctional aspects of the cloud paradigm, among which cloud security stands out. Several approaches to security have been described and summarized in general surveys on cloud security techniques. The survey in this article focuses on the interface between cloud security and cloud security assurance.
		First, we provide an overview of the state of the art on cloud security. Then, we introduce the notion of cloud security assurance and analyze its growing impact on cloud security approaches. Finally, we present some recommendations for the development of next-generation cloud security and assurance solutions.

		The term big data has come into use recently to refer to the ever-increasing amount of information that organisations are storing, processing and analysing, owing to the growing number of information sources in use. According to research conducted by IDC, there were 1.8 zettabytes (1.8 trillion gigabytes) of information created and replicated in 2011 alone and that amount is doubling every two years.1 Within the next decade, the amount of information managed by enterprise datacentres will grow by 50 times, whereas the number of IT professionals will expand by just 1.5 times. Data volumes continue to expand as they take in an ever-wider range of sources, much of which is in unstructured form. Organisations want to extract value from that data to uncover the opportunities for the business that it contains. But the centralised nature of big data stores creates new security challenges. Traditional tools are not, on their own, up to the task of processing the information the data
		contains, let alone ensuring it's secure in the process. Colin Tankard of Digital Pathways explains that controls need to be placed around the data itself, rather than the applications and systems that store the data.

WSCL conversation definitions are themselves XML documents and can therefore be interpreted by Web services infrastructures and development tools.
